The aim of this thesis is to give the reader a gentle but thorough introduction to the vast web of ideas underlying the realization of the geometric Langlands correspondence in the physics of quantum field theory (QFT). It begins with a pedagogically-motivated introduction to the relevant mathematical concepts in algebraic geometry and topology aimed towards physicists, and goes on to provide an introduction to classical and quantum field theory and gauge theory for a mathematical audience. With the machinery of both sides in place, the more complicated phenomena associated with gauge theory is explored, specifically instantons, topological operators, and electric-magnetic duality. We conclude with a description of the connection between the Langlands correspondence and $\mathcal N = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) via a striking property known as $S$-duality. A large part of the goal of this thesis is to fill in gaps otherwise skipped over by the literature related to this topic, so that an advanced undergraduate or graduate student might have a good exposition into this field.
