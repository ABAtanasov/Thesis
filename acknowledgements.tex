I would like to firstly thank Professor Yoo for agreeing to be my advisor and for dedicating much of his time (not to mention his Monday lunches) to help guide me along as I worked through understanding the many ideas necessary to write this thesis. I especially want to thank him for his patience when I was struggling with the more difficult parts of this program, and for his excellent ability to get to the heart of matters in pointing out what was important for me to understand.

I would also like to thank the past professors that I have had at Yale for building my background up so that I could complete this thesis. In particular, I would like to thank Prof. David Poland for giving me the unique opportunity to get my hands dirty working with conformal theory early in my undergraduate career, and for his guidance throughout my time at Yale. Second, I would like to thank Professors Igor Frenkel and Walter Goldberger for providing me the courses that challenged me and pushed me to the furthest limits of any other academic experience at Yale.

Lastly, I would like to thank my friends and colleagues, Aaron Hillman and Andrew Saydjari, for being part of this great journey with me. I want to thank them for the numerous and deeply meaningful conversations that they engaged me with. I wish them all the best in their future scientific pursuits, and look forward to seeing them fly.
